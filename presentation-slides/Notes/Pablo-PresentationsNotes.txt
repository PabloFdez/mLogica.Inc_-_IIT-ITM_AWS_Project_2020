QuickSight: Pablo

- Introduction to QuickSight and Data Visualization

[Notes]:
	· Data Visualization is not new. 
	  Communicating data in a visual way has been done during hundreds of years.

	· What is new is the increasing interest in the subject produced by the new technological developments 
	  -> and the transparency and accessibility of data during the last decade.

	· Some of the main benefits of Data Visualization could be:
		+ Understanding Business Data
		+ Helping the Target Audience to focus on the Business Insights
		+ Improving Decision Making
		+ Providing Summary and Data Patterns or Trends Reports

	· Data pipelines, Distributed File Systems or Real-Time Analysis and Visualization are some of the most important
	  -> and used technological advances in this field used by platforms like AWS, Azure, IBM Watson, Tableau, etc. 

- What is AWS QuickSight?

[Notes]:
	· Cloud Base Platform Service
	· Implements a Pay-Per-Use Model
	· Enables the user to create Visualizations, perform Ad Hoc Analysis and get Business Insights form the data
	· It's presented by AWS as Business Intelligence and Analytics Platform

- Compare QS with Tableau and Power BI

[Notes]:
All 3 are very powerful Business Intelligence and Analysis tools with a few differences

	· About the pricing
		If the company has a heavy AWS footprint QuickSight is highly recommend as the pricing 
		-> would be lower than Tableau and a bit similar to Power BI 

	· Learning Curve
		AWS QuickSight has a highly intuitive interface and is very easy to set up.

		In the case of Power BI, if the user has experience using data sources on Excel the 
		-> learning phase would be smoother. But in the case of Tableau, the learning curve would be a bit steeper.

	· Data Sources
		In this case Power BI is the most limited platform according to Data Sources compatibility.

		Also, when using Tableau and Power BI all the sources should be integrated or connected manually while using AWS QuickSight
		-> the Data Sources are automatically discovered implementing mutiple service compatibility and external sources adding.

How QuickSight Works: Pablo

- Architecture of QuickSight

	[Notes]:

	A great advantage is that QuickSight can automatically detect AWS data sources and can also work with other data sources.

	AWS QuickSight supports a great variety of Data Sources like:
		+ File Data Sources (CSV/TSV, JSON or Excel Files)
		+ Software as a Services Data Sources (GitHub, Salesforce or Twitter)
		+ Relational Data Sources (Like multiple Amazon Services [Athena, Aurora,Redsihft, S3], Apache Spark, MariaDB, SQL Server, Presto, SnowFlake, etc.)

	AWS QuickSight enables organizations to scale to hundreds of thousands of users and delivers responsive performance by using a robust in-memory engine which is called SPICE.

	So, going deeper, SPICE (which stands of Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory, Calculation, Engine) is a platform to provide visualizations, dashboards, and machine learning in a performant manner.
